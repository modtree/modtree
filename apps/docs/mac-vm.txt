open terminal
run `git`
if this is the first time you run git, mac os will prompt you to install xcode tools.
do that
if `git` already returns a git help message, then you're good to proceed to the next step.

* install homebrew by running the command found on brew.sh
* be sure to read the final output for any post-installation instructions for
  brew.
* After you've following any post-installation instructions, check that brew is
  installed by quitting the terminal entirely, reopening it, and running
  `brew`.
* The brew help message should show up.

You can install node however you want, but this is our recommended way of doing it:

brew install n # to install n, the node version manager
sudo n 16      # to install node v16

Again, you can install yarn v1 however you want, but this is our recommended way:
After installing node, you can now run

corepack enable # to install yarn

if permissions are insufficient, run

sudo corepack enable

to confirm that that worked, run `yarn --version`. be sure that it starts with `1.`

install postgresql with

brew install postgresql

to start postgresql automatically every time you boot (no window will show up - it's just a background service)

you can run

```
brew services start postgresql
```

there are also ways in which you can start postgresql manually
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7975556/how-can-i-start-postgresql-server-on-mac-os-x

to check that postgres is running okay, run `psql postgres`

`psql` is the command that opens a connection to the database. `postgres` is the name of the database you want to open.
by default, the database named `postgres` exists so you can do `psql postgres` but if you try `psql some_cool_db` then there will be an error saying
that `some_cool_db` doesn't exist yet, rightfully so.

to solve that, you can run `createdb some_cool_db` first, and only then connect to it with `psql some_cool_db`

to delete a database, run `dropdb some_cool_db`.
