# PostgreSQL

Modtree's database is currently supported by PostgreSQL, using TypeORM to assist us in managing our relations.

## Seed file

Our only seed file is `postgres-modules-only.sql`. This seed file contains 6189 entries in the `Module` and `ModuleCondensed` tables, which corresponds to 6189 NUS modules at the time of pulling data from NUSMods.

## Migrations

As we are not in production currently, we group all migrations into one migration from the only seed file.

If we make changes to the properties of entities, we run `packages/database/migrate.sh`, which

1. Restores from our only seed
2. Deletes all present migrations
3. Generates a new migration

and as such, there will only be one final migration.
