# TypeORM

- Entities are at `packages/database/src/entity`, and
- Repositories are at `packages/database/src/repository`.

We use the [data mapper](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/active-record-data-mapper.md) pattern, so our entities only contain their properties, and our repositories contain the functionality.
