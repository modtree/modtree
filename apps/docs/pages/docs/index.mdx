# Modtree Documentation

<Features />

Modtree seeks to leverage and consolidate [already-available
data][nusmods-api] in a graph-oriented interactive visualization tool
in order to:

- Increase clarity in degree planning
- Allow students to efficiently experiment with different degree paths
- Minimize mental overhead and time spent to source for degree data
- Improve module information accessibility

## The problem

Currently, the there is no interactive way to visualize degree
requirements. Text editors don't provide enough flexibility to switch
between different module combinations, and NUSMods, the only platform
that is aware of module pre-requisites, only lets you plan one degree.
What if you want to see how life would be like if you took Linear
Algebra before taking Calculus?
