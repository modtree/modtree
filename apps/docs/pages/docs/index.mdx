# Modtree Documentation

<Features />

Modtree seeks to leverage and consolidate [already-available
data][nusmods-api] in a graph-oriented interactive visualization tool
in order to:

- Increase clarity in degree planning
- Allow students to efficiently experiment with different degree paths
- Minimize mental overhead and time spent to source for degree data
- Improve module information accessibility

## The problem

> 6000+ modules, but you only do 40.

Currently, the there is no interactive way for university students to
visualize degree requirements. Text editors don't provide enough
flexibility to switch between different module combinations, and
NUSMods, the only platform that is aware of module pre-requisites,
only lets you plan one degree. What if you want to see how life would
be like if you took Linear Algebra before taking Calculus?

## The endgame

### Increase clarity in degree planning

Modtree encourages you to know what's the minimum requirements before
building up. After you key in graduation requirements, modtree will be
able to tell you

- By when you must clear certain key modules
- The feasibility of changing your major at any point along the way

### Improve accessibility

Specifically, that of module information. When modules are presented
on graph, pre-requisites can be visually explored. Other information
are just a right-click away, or available through the search bar.

### Let users experiment with different paths

Likely, there are many ways of completing the same degree. Modtree
lets you create as many graphs as you want so you can explore all
these ways in parallel.
