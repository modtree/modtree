# Build Prerequisites

This guide is written specially those who have never installed any of
the build pre-requisites before, and need to go through the tussle of
the first-time setup.

- [Mac OS](#mac-os)

## Mac OS

The Mac OS guide is targeted at a fresh Mac installation. Note that
this particular guide is an opinionated route of getting things
installed. To our knowledge, it's the perfect balance between
speed-running Modtree's install and putting you in a the best position
for any future projects.

Overall steps needed:

1. [Install git](#install-git)
2. [Install homebrew](#install-homebrew)
3. [Install node](#install-node)
4. [Install yarn](#install-yarn)
5. [Install postgresql](#install-postgresql)
6. [Install docker](#install-docker)

### Install git

Open a terminal window and run `git`. A window should pop up prompting
you to install standard xcode tools. Follow those instructions, and
you will end up with `git` installed.

To check if you have `git` installed, run `git`. You should see the
`git` help text.

### Install homebrew

Head over to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) and follow their install
instructions.

Be sure to read the final output for any post-installation actions.

To check if you have `brew` installed, run `brew`. You should see the
`brew` help text.

### Install node

Instead of installing `node` directly, this guide will show you how to
install `n`, a node version manager, and then `node` itself.

```
brew install n
```

```bash
sudo n 16 # modtree uses node v16
```

To check if you have `node` installed correctly, run `node --version`.
Make sure the output starts with a "v16".

```bash
$ node --version
# v16.15.0
```

### Install yarn

To install `yarn` using the following method, you need to have `node`
installed first.

```bash
corepack enable
```

If that fails and requires elevated permissions:

```bash
sudo corepack enable
```

To check if you have `yarn` installed correctly, run `yarn --version`.
Make sure the output starts with a "1".

```bash
$ yarn --version
# 1.22.18
```

### Install postgresql

You can install postgresql using homebrew with:

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Upon completion, postgresql is installed, but not started by default.
If you try to open a connection to postgresql, it will throw an error.

To start it, run:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

To check if postgres is working, you can run:

```bash
psql postgres
```

It should replace your command prompt with postgresql's command
prompt.

```bash
$ psql postgres
# psql (14.3)
# Type "help" for help.
#
# postgres=#
```

You can exit the postgresql prompt by running `exit`.

`psql` is a command that opens a connection to the database.

`postgres` is the name of the database you want to open.

The database you want to open needs to exist in order for the
connection to be established.

You can try running `psql some_cool_db`. There will be an error saying
that `some_cool_db` doesn't exist yet, rightfully so.

To solve that, you can run `createdb some_cool_db` first, and only
then connect to it with `psql some_cool_db`

To delete a database, run `dropdb some_cool_db`.

### Install docker
