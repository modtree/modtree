## Building

### TypeScript

TypeScript is _the_ programming language of Modtree. We find that types help to
communicate a large part of what each function and data structure is trying to
accomplish.

Apart from having static types, it is also useful that the entire tech stack can
be written in this language, so sharing code is highly feasible.

### Webpack

Webpack lets us bundle a large amount of code into just one executable
JavaScript file, allowing for a minimal production runtime file.

### GitHub Actions

Modtree's CI/CD runner, which automatically tests code on every push, and
deploys our services on every merge to the main branch.

## Database

### PostgreSQL

Postgres is our one and only database type (for now). We tried MySQL but ditched
it because of the simple pragmatic reason that we couldn't find free online
hosts which offer a reasonable amount of storage space.

In the longer term, we'd like to explore graph databases to handle our module
dependency relations. Graph relation functions written in SQL will likely never
be as natural as those written in GraphQL, so extending such functions will
probably be easier with GraphQL.

### TypeORM

TypeORM is a object-relational mapping (ORM) tool. It provides us with an
object-oriented abstraction for the database, facilitating development.

TypeORM also has the flexibility to allow us to write SQL queries directly in
TypeScript, and also plays nice with TypeScript’s types and interfaces.

## Backend

### Express

Our server functions and API endpoints are handled by Express. Express provides
us with route matching and parsing capabilities so we don’t have to worrying
about implementing it.

### tRPC

tRPC helps us to statically type APIs. We are thus able to share types between
our client (frontend) and server, so that we are confident in using our API
correctly. Given that our project’s main language is TypeScript, this is a very
useful addition to our application.

### NextAuth.js

With NextAuth.js, users can now authenticate using social logins. We currently
support Google, Github, and Facebook.

Since our target audience is NUS undergraduates or incoming undergraduates, they
are likely to own one of the abovementioned social accounts. By having social
logins, we reduce the barrier of entry for using our app, encouraging users to
sign up as it is hassle-free.

## Frontend

### React

This is the core language that all our frontend is based on. Specifically, we
write with the intended style of React 17, with hooks instead of classes. So
instead of having classes that extend a base React Component, our frontend
components are Functional Components whose states are managed with hooks such as
useState and useEffect.

### Next.js

Of course, we had the choice to use pure React.js, but we opted to use it on top
of Next.js because of its extra routing capabilities. Through these routes we
use their API functionality to manage authentication and centralize our backend
calls.

### React Flow

This is the library that is responsible for displaying nodes and edges that
represent modules and their requirements. React Flow is an open-source tool
which lets us skip past the issue of implementing togglable, draggable,
(multi)selectable nodes, and get right into the core business of working on
module dependency logic.

### Redux

Redux is a core part of our frontend. It centralizes our application’s state and
abstracts the logic away from frontend components. This helps us to get a single
source of truth for the global state of our application, so that any changes a
user makes is correctly updated throughout our application.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS allows us to write CSS directly in JSX, a major convenience when we
are building fresh components and are in the experimental stage. Though this
breaks the philosophy of the cascade, it provides us a much needed speed boost
when doing up proof-of-concepts. It also still lets us use vanilla CSS, which we
do move over to for more mature components.

## Testing

### Jest

We write our tests in TypeScript, using Jest as our testing framework.

At Milestone 2, we spin up a database instance whenever we run unit tests for
our core functionality. Since we also wanted to keep our code coverage high,
this made our unit tests run for longer than 2 minutes, both locally and in the
CI.

The bottleneck of the unit tests is spinning up the database instance. Hence, we
decided to introduce mocking to eliminate such external dependencies from unit
testing. As a result, our unit tests run in 10 seconds now.

### Cypress

We use Cypress for end-to-end testing. Cypress spawns a browser and helps us to
simulate user actions such as clicking and typing into a text box, effectively
simulating a real user. We are also able to assert that certain elements are
loaded in the page. Overall, this helps us to confirm that our core business
logic works.
