# Modtree's tech stack

For context, here's the list of key technologies that Modtree uses,
listed from the most abstract to the most visually concrete.

[TypeScript](#typescript)
&middot; [Nx](#nx)
&middot; [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
&middot; [TypeORM](#typeorm)
&middot; [Jest](#jest)
&middot; [Express](#express)
&middot; [Auth0](#auth0)
&middot; [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)
&middot; [React](#react)
&middot; [Next](#next)
&middot; [React Flow](#react-flow)
&middot; [Tailwind CSS](#tailwind-css)

## Building

### TypeScript

TypeScript is _the_ programming language of Modtree. We find that
types help to communicate a large part of what each function and data
structure is trying to accomplish.

Apart from having static types, it is also useful that the entire tech
stack can be written in this language, so sharing code is highly
feasible.

### Nx

Nx is a build system for projects, and allows us to never have to
build the same code twice. If it decides that a section of code hasn't
changed, it will not build/lint/test it again, and instead pull from
a cache and re-display that output.

It also support remote-caching, something that our CI takes advantages
of for speed improvements.

As of Milestone 1, we were using Turborepo instead of Nx, but its
remote caching was unreliable, so we didn't get much benefit from it.
Furthermore, with Turborepo, there was a `node_modules` directory
under each of our sub-project. Nx, on the other hand, has only one
`node_modules` from which every project reads from, allowing us to
standardize even the version of each dependency across the whole
project.

Nx also provides a graph visualizer that lets us see which sub-project
depends on which other sub-projects. This is useful in quickly
detecting project-level circular dependency. In fact, Nx throws an
error before building if it detects a circular dependency.

## Database

### PostgreSQL

Postgres is our one and only database type (for now). We tried MySQL
but ditched it because of the simple pragmatic reason that we couldn't
find free online hosts which offer a reasonable amount of storage
space.

In the longer term, we'd like to explore graph databases to handle
our module dependency relations. Graph relation functions written in
SQL will likely never be as natural as those written in GraphQL, so
extending such functions will probably be easier with GraphQL.

### TypeORM

To make our SQL queries integrate well with TypeScript, we use
TypeORM. It allows us to write SQL queries directly in TypeScript, and
also plays nice with TypeScript's types and interfaces.

## Backend

### Jest

the testing framework of choice. Together with Supertest, we test
every piece of code we write to have confidence in our current state.

### Express

Our server functions and API endpoints are handled by Express. Express
provides us with route matching and parsing capabilities so we don’t
have to worrying about implementing it.

### Auth0

Auth0 handles authentication for us, and also provides a very clean
frontend to do so. However, its service to integrate with a database
is a paid one, so we opted for a more detached approach. Auth0 only
handles our user metadata, and nothing else. User data such as modules
taken and degrees planned are still hosted on our database. These
separate user entities are linked by Auth0’s user id.

### GitHub Actions

Modtree's CI/CD runner, which automatically tests code on every push,
and deploys our services on every merge to the main branch.

## Frontend

### React

This is the core language that all our frontend is based on.
Specifically, we write with the intended style of React 17, with hooks
instead of classes. So instead of having classes that extend a base
React Component, our frontend components are Functional Components
whose states are managed with hooks such as useState and useEffect.

### Next.js

Of course, we had the choice to use pure React.js, but we opted to use
it on top of Next.js because of its extra routing capabilities.
Through these routes we use their API functionality to manage
authentication and centralize our backend calls.

### React Flow

This is the library that is responsible for displaying nodes and edges
that represent modules and their requirements. React Flow is an
open-source tool which lets us skip past the issue of implementing
togglable, draggable, (multi)selectable nodes, and get right into the
core business of working on module dependency logic.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS allows us to write CSS directly in JSX, a major
convenience when we are building fresh components and are in the
experimental stage. Though this breaks the philosophy of the cascade,
it provides us a much needed speed boost when doing up
proof-of-concepts. It also still lets us use vanilla CSS, which we do
move over to for more mature components.
