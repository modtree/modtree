# Setting up modtree

## Quick start

- Install [build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites) on your system
- `git clone https://github.com/modtree/modtree.git`
- `cd modtree && yarn`

## Running modtree

- Start Docker Desktop (this starts the Docker daemon)
- `yarn up` to spin up the database. Two databases will be started. One at `http://localhost:4000` to serve the API server, and one at `http://localhost:4001` to use for integration tests.
- `yarn dev` to serve the frontend website at `http://localhost:3000` and the API server at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Alternatively, `yarn dev:web` and `yarn dev:server` separately.
- `yarn dev:docs` to serve the documentation website at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Unit/Integration testing

`yarn test` will spawn our test runner. Running it for the first time may be slower as it needs to be compiled.

## E2E testing

- Make sure both the website and server are running (run `yarn dev` to start both)
- `yarn cy` will spawn the cypress test runner, printing a usage guide to your terminal. Running it for the first time may be slower as it needs to be compiled.

## Uninstall

modtree doesn't install anything outside of the project root
directory. To clear out all modtree data, simply delete the project
directory.
