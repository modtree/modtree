# Tests

Currently, only database functions have tests written.

## Running database tests

The database source is located at `packages/database` from project root.

```
cd packages/database
```

To run all tests:

```
yarn test:all
```

Note that test files that end with `pull.test.ts` require an internet
connection to run, since they test pulling data from [NUSMods
API][nusmods-api]

[nusmods-api]: https://api.nusmods.com/v2/

To exclude the test that pulls all 6000+ module details from NUSMods,
run

```
yarn test:ci
```
