# Deploying Modtree

All deployments are triggered by GitHub Actions at
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

This page documents configurations not found in the
[`modtree/modtree`](https://github.com/modtree/modtree) GitHub
repository.

## Documentation (Vercel)

This deployment is unique in that it doesn't depend on any outside
project at all. Hence the root is shifted to the docs project root.

Deployment root directory: `apps/docs`

Install command: `yarn bundle`

Build command: `next build --no-lint`

Output directory: `apps/docs/.next`

## Frontend (Vercel)

Deployment root directory: same as workspace root.

Build command: `next build apps/web`

Output directory: `apps/web/.next`
