# Deploying Modtree

All deployments are triggered by GitHub Actions at
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Documentation (Vercel)

This deployment is unique in that it doesn't depend on any outside
project at all. Hence the root is shifted to the docs project root.

Deployment root directory: `apps/docs`

Build command: `yarn build:docs`

Output directory: `apps/docs/.next`

## Frontend (Vercel)

Deployment root directory: same as workspace root.

Build command: `yarn build:web`

Output directory: `apps/web/.next`

## Backend (Heroku)

Deployment root directory: same as workspace root.

Build command: `yarn build:server`

Output directory: `dist/apps/server`
