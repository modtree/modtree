# Glossary

A running list of computer science, mathematical, graph theory, and build system terms and jargon used in the documentation.

### Module

Contains enough information for us to execute modtree's core business
logic.

### ModuleFull

Contains all information about a module.

### ModuleCondensed

Contains the title and module code for a NUS module. Used for the search bar.

### Degree

This represents a degree template, containing modules required for degree completion. This can be customized by users.

### User

This represents a user in our application. Here we can keep track of modules done and saved degrees.

### Graph

Given a `Degree` with required modules, there are multiple ways of clearing the same degree (clearing modules in a different order, or if there are Unrestricted Electives). Each `Graph` will correspond to one such plan.
