## Problem

<h3>Hard to visualize degree requirements</h3>

In NUS, degree requirements are presented in textual form. The required modules are usually presented in a bullet point list. It is not obvious when you can take these modules, and how they are related to each other.

<Image src="/images/milestone-3/CS degree requirements.png" />

Additionally, there are many ways to go about completing the same degree. You can choose to clear all your core modules first, or you can explore electives and specializations first.

<h3>Degree requirements aren’t exhaustive</h3>

In some degrees, in order to clear the pre-requisites to study some core modules, you even need to study modules outside of the core list. For example, in [Computer Engineering](https://ceg.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/requirements/), EE4204 Computer Networks is listed as a degree requirement. However, one of its pre-requisites, ST2334, is not listed in the core modules.

<h3>Module relations are complicated</h3>

Students can refer to NUSMods to find out what modules one might unlock (red modules), after they complete a module (CS2106).

However, the red modules might have other pre-requisites which the student has not completed. Hence, the modules the student unlocks is only a subset of the red modules, and the student has to click one by one to understand what modules they can do next.

<Image src="/images/milestone-3/CS2106 pre-req tree.png" />

<h3>Many modules, but only 40 are relevant</h3>

There are 6000+ modules to choose from. Considering a 160MC degree, each student only does 40+ each.

<h3>Not knowing which module to clear first</h3>

For a freshman,

- Completing MA2001 unlocks MA2101/S, MA2214, MA3252
- Completing MA2002 unlocks MA2108/S, MA2311, MA2104, ST2131/MA2116, ST2334

Presented in this manner, MA2002 is likely the better option to take first. This is not clear to a freshman.

<h3>Hard deadlines for clearing modules</h3>

In order to complete a language studies minor, students need to study language modules up to the 6th level. This means 6 semesters of content, and this means that Y2S1 is typically the latest can start, if they are interested in a language studies minor.

<h3>Not sure what electives to take</h3>

While NUS does provide the degree requirements, it includes major electives that you can choose from, and you will have space for unrestricted electives as well. This means that there is a lot of room for variation.

Students might want to pursue a specific field in future, but they are not sure what modules they should pick for that field. Students might also be unsure if certain module combinations make sense, and they might want to find out what others are doing.

---

## Target audience

All NUS undergraduates, and possibly pre-university students.

---

## Motivation

<h3>General target audience</h3>

When you’re stuck not knowing what mods to take next semester, or just want general recommendations about what modules to take, your current alternatives are friends, seniors and perhaps the NUSMods Planner.

Many may have reached the point where either they don’t know what modules they are eligible for, or they lose track of what modules are required for them to graduate. This problem is made worse by the ever-changing graduation requirements, so reaching out to seniors may not be helpful at all.

Some students start a new semester not having enough module choices as a result of not taking enough prerequisites, forcing them to take unrelated modules for the upcoming semester.

<h3>Students considering specializations/double degree/major/minor</h3>

Some students might be interested in multiple different specializations, and they might not be sure what to pick. The overhead of having to keep track of what modules are completed for a certain specialization makes it troublesome to consider different specializations.

---

## Objectives

1. Increase clarity in degree planning
2. Allow students to efficiently experiment with different degree paths
3. Minimize mental overhead and time spent to source for degree data
4. Improve module information accessibility

---

## User stories

<h3>Current undergrad not sure what to choose at ModReg</h3>

He can go on modtree and draw up a graph of the modules he’s already taken, and fill in his current degree requirements. Modtree will then be able to suggest to him what to do next in order to keep his options the most open (i.e. the modules that satisfy the most number of other module’s pre-requisites).

<h3>Current undergrad thinking of switching majors</h3>

He can fill in his current degree requirements, and then also the requirements of the degree he’s thinking of switching to. He can then draw out multiple graphs to try and see how his current modules done fits into either degree. Of course, he can also create, save, and even duplicate graphs as he modifies them, preventing the need to write everything from scratch.

<h3>
  Current undergrad unsure of how to fit in desired modules into their
  curriculum
</h3>

Some modules are offered during particular semesters, and they could be pre-requisites for other desired modules. By building a degree in modtree and drawing up a graph, modtree will calculate the latest semester that the pre-requisite must be taken, in order to take the desired module before graduation.

<h3>
  Current undergrad wants to see if it is possible to graduate before the
  expected date
</h3>

Some students might want to graduate in less than 4 years, or they might be double degree students who want to graduate within 4 years. By indicating the desired graduation date, modtree will assist in creating an overall degree plan, so the student knows how much and when to overload, and which modules to prioritize, so that there is no issue in clearing pre-requisites in time.

## User flow

With core business logic implemented as part of Milestone 3, we want to be clear about what user actions there can be at any point in time, so that we can write end-to-end tests for these actions, to confirm that they work.

The diagram at [this miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOjzV8D0=/) summarizes what a user can do, by indicating what actions a user can take at certain screens.

## Tech stack

<h3>Building</h3>

<h4>TypeScript</h4>

TypeScript is *the* programming language of Modtree. We find that types help to communicate a large part of what each function and data structure is trying to accomplish.

Apart from having static types, it is also useful that the entire tech stack can be written in this language, so sharing code is highly feasible.

<h4>Nx</h4>

Nx is a build system for projects, and allows us to never have to build the same code twice. If it decides that a section of code hasn’t changed, it will not build/lint/test it again, and instead pull from either the local cache or the remote cache. This means if one developer has built a sub-project, another developer can benefit from his cache remotely.

As of Milestone 1, we were using Turborepo instead of Nx, but its remote caching was unreliable, so we didn’t get much benefit from it. Furthermore, with Turborepo, there was a `node_modules` directory under each of our sub-project. Nx, on the other hand, has only one `node_modules` from which every project reads from, allowing us to standardize even the version of each dependency across the whole project.

Nx also provides a graph visualizer that lets us see which sub-project depends on which other sub-projects. This is useful in quickly detecting project-level circular dependency. In fact, Nx throws an error before building if it detects a circular dependency.

<h4>Webpack</h4>

Webpack lets us bundle a large amount of code into just one executable JavaScript file, allowing for a minimal production runtime file.

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<h4>React</h4>

This is the core language that all our frontend is based on. Specifically, we write with the intended style of React 17, with hooks instead of classes. So instead of having classes that extend a base React `Component`, our frontend components are Functional Components whose states are managed with hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.

<h4>React Flow</h4>

This is the library that is responsible for displaying nodes and edges that represent modules and their requirements. React Flow is an open-source tool which lets us skip past the issue of implementing togglable, draggable, (multi)selectable nodes, and get right into the core business of working on module dependency logic.

<h4>Redux</h4>

Redux is a core part of our frontend. It centralizes our application’s state and abstracts the logic away from frontend components. This helps us to get a single source of truth for the global state of our application, so that any changes a user makes is correctly updated throughout our application.

<h4>Next.js</h4>

Of course, we had the choice to use pure React.js, but we opted to use it on top of Next.js because of its extra routing capabilities. Through these routes we use their API functionality to manage authentication and centralize our backend calls.

<h4>Tailwind CSS</h4>

Tailwind CSS allows us to write CSS directly in JSX, a major convenience when we are building fresh components and are in the experimental stage. Though this breaks the philosophy of the cascade, it provides us a much needed speed boost when doing up proof-of-concepts. It also still lets us use vanilla CSS, which we do move over to for more mature components.

<h3>Backend</h3>

<h4>Express.js</h4>

Our server functions and API endpoints are handled by Express. Express provides us with route matching and parsing capabilities so we don’t have to worrying about implementing it.

<h4>tRPC</h4>

tRPC helps us to statically type APIs. We are thus able to share types between our client (frontend) and server, so that we are confident in using our API correctly. Given that our project’s main language is TypeScript, this is a very useful addition to our application.

<h4>NextAuth.js</h4>

With NextAuth.js, users can now authenticate using social logins. We currently support Google, Github, and Facebook.

Since our target audience is NUS undergraduates or incoming undergraduates, they are likely to own one of the abovementioned social accounts. By having social logins, we reduce the barrier of entry for using our app, encouraging users to sign up as it is hassle-free.

<h3>Database</h3>

<h4>PostgreSQL</h4>

Postgres is our one and only database type (for now). We tried MySQL but ditched it because of the simple pragmatic reason that we couldn’t find free online hosts which offer a reasonable amount of storage space.

If we have bandwidth, we’d like to explore graph databases to handle our module dependency relations. Graph relation functions written in SQL will likely never be as natural as those written in GraphQL, so extending such functions will probably be easier with GraphQL.

<h4>TypeORM</h4>

TypeORM is a object-relational mapping (ORM) tool. It provides us with an object-oriented abstraction for the database, facilitating development.

TypeORM also has the flexibility to allow us to write SQL queries directly in TypeScript, and also plays nice with TypeScript’s types and interfaces.

<h3>Testing</h3>

<h4>Jest</h4>

We write our tests in TypeScript, using Jest as our testing framework.

At Milestone 2, we spin up a database instance whenever we run unit tests for our core functionality. Since we also wanted to keep our code coverage high, this made our unit tests run for longer than 2 minutes, both locally and in the CI.

The bottleneck of the unit tests is spinning up the database instance. Hence, we decided to introduce mocking to eliminate such external dependencies from unit testing. As a result, our unit tests run in 10 seconds now.

<h4>GitHub Actions</h4>

We use GitHub Actions to automate our testing, and also to provide a third opinion on the state of our code. It runs for every pull request and every merge, so that we are confident that our code changes do not break other functionalities.

<h4>Cypress</h4>

We use Cypress for end-to-end testing. Cypress spawns a browser and helps us to simulate user actions such as clicking and typing into a text box, effectively simulating a real user. We are also able to assert that certain elements are loaded in the page. Overall, this helps us to confirm that our core business logic works.

## Docs

Our docs runs on Next.js, and our content is mostly written in MDX, which is markdown that allows for JSX. We have 3 content tabs: Docs, API, Blog.

<h3>Docs</h3>

The docs tab consists of general information about modtree. It includes a developer guide, so it is easy to onboard new developers to the team.

Since Milestone 1, we have done weekly releases, summarizing our changes each week in the Changelog section. A more detailed changelog is avaliable at our project repository’s root.

<h3>API</h3>

Our API docs are currently not updated, as our API has been rapidly evolving since Milestone 2.

We have migrated our API to use tRPC, which allows us to statically type our APIs. However, tRPC API endpoints do not conform to the OpenAPI specification. We hope to expose our API so that users can programatically interact with our application. Hence, we are in the midst of migrating our tRPC API endpoints to conform to the OpenAPI specification.

We will update our API docs as part of the OpenAPI migration.

<h3>Blog</h3>

The Blog tab contains our Milestone READMEs.

## Software engineering practices

<h3>Unit tests</h3>

To enable major code refactoring should the need arise, it’s far more comforting to have a reliable set of unit tests to let you know that your code does in fact still perform in the same way as it used to.

<h3>Integration tests</h3>

To ensure a base level of confidence that our backend code runs smoothly in production, we have integration tests that test our functions against a real database.

<h3>End-to-end tests</h3>

We use end-to-end tests to ensure that any changes we make to our codebase does not affect our business logic. Thus, we are more confident to make releases to our production environment.

<h3>Separate production & development deployments</h3>

Having separate deployments allows us to have more confidence in pushing our latest code live. If our latest code has a bug, it only affects the development deployment, and not the main production environment. This helps us to maintain high uptime.

<h3>Continuous integration</h3>

Unit tests are ran on every key event. Pushes to particular branches, whenever a pull request is opened, whenever someone requests for a PR review, etc. Test results are also sent to a telegram group so that we don’t have to check Github Actions all the time.

<h3>Continuous delivery</h3>

Frontend, backend, and documentation deployments are automatic. When we merge a pull request to `main`, the development deployment gets updated. When we make a Github Release, the production deployment gets updated.

<h3>Branch protection rules</h3>

The main branch requires all CI checks to pass before being able to merge. This helps ensure a higher base level for the standard of production code.

<h3>Keys security</h3>

No API keys are exposed on our public repo. We use `.env` files to safe-keep our keys, and we only commit an `.env.example` file to show what keys we’re expecting a developer to have.

<h3>Version control</h3>

We use git for version control, enabling multiple people to work on the same project.

<h3>Commit messages</h3>

After Milestone 1, we have begun to follow the conventional commit message format for clarity in what we do.

## Features

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<h4>What’s done</h4>

The bulk of our progress in Milestone 1 was in our database functions. We chose to focus development there at the start because we wanted a solid foundation to build things from.

At Milestone 2, we have implemented every foreseeable database function, and have started work in the frontend.

Now, as of Milestone 3, we have implemented the full flow of a user planning a degree. Also, the entire user state is persisted in database. Users can toggle between graphs, add and remove modules, mark each module as done/doing/planned, and so on.

<h4>What’s next</h4>

After Milestone 3, we will be working on the stability of the 10+ core functions that users can execute while manipulating their own data. After that, we will look into implementing features such as module suggestion and community module relations.

---

## What's done

<h3>End user features</h3>

<h4>Degree as a graph</h4>

Like how in role-playing games you can build your character’s skill tree, modtree lets you build your degree plan like a skill tree but out of modules instead of skills.

We call it a graph because modules can have multiple pre-requisites, and we like to be technically correct.

In this graph (or tree), each node is a NUS module, and a directed edge from A to B means that A is a pre-requisite of B.

With the full overview of modules and their relations, you gain a better understanding of your degree requirements. In the case of Computer Engineering students, you might be surprised and find out that ST2334 is a new indirect core module you have to clear.

<h4>Authentication and remote storage</h4>

In this technological age, it is common for students to have multiple devices. Modtree provides user authentication with through popular account providers, specifically Google, Facebook, and also GitHub. Users can log in with any of these providers and connect back to the same account.

User’s graphs and degrees are saved remotely, so as long as they log back in to the same account, they have full access to previously entered data.

<h3>Developer features</h3>

<h4>Faster server builds</h4>

Instead of using Nx to build our server, we now only use it to check for circular dependencies. We use webpack to build it instead, which take the build time from at least 20s to an average of 4s. With webpack, we can also monitor the codebase for live changes and rebuild the server in realtime, allowing for a smoother developer experience.

<h4>CI scripting</h4>

Make use of GitHub workflow’s matrix strategy to execute multiple tests at once without having to manually define multiple jobs.

Test commands to be ran on the CI checks are abstracted out to a simple json file which we can edit easily.

<h4>Custom GitHub action</h4>

Previously, we relied on a GitHub Marketplace action to send test reports to telegram. Now, we have a custom action at `.github/actions` in our repository. This grants us fine-tuned control over how results are reported, and also lets us have a cleaner GitHub Workflow `yml` file.

<h4>Improved test runner</h4>

With Nx, we were able to run tests per-project. However, not all projects are created equal and some required further slicing and dicing of tests. So we wrote a test runner that lets us orchestrate testing more finely, called with `yarn test` from workspace root.

It lets us define however many Jest projects we want, instead of having one Jest project per sub-directory of `apps` and `libs`. This lets us run each Jest project independently.

It also lets us group tests together. We have an alias `yarn test core` which runs all unit tests for `graph`, `degree`, `user`, and `module` functions. This usually serves as a first pass before moving on to check with integration tests or the full test suite.

It has a utility that scans the entire workspace for new Jest configs and add them to the `tests.json` at root, where we define all configs for tests.

<h4>Mocked unit tests</h4>

Mock database and imported library functions to significantly boost the speed of our unit tests. Compared to our previous set of fastest tests, these run at least 5x faster, since they can also run in parallel. This is a major boost to our code-time productivity since the feedback loop is faster.

<h4>Semi-automatic migration script</h4>

Whenever there’s a change in database schema, we need to run a migration to get the production database up to date with the new schema. For this we wrote three scripts:

1. A script to compare the current state of production schema against our current code’s schema.

- when there’s a change in schema

<Image src="/images/milestone-3/test-connect-fail.png" />

- when the schema is up to date

<Image src="/images/milestone-3/test-connect-ok.png" />

<h4>Containerization</h4>

An image of our database is on hub.docker.com, along with an image of our server. The source of these images can be found in our repo, and though we haven’t used them to their full potential, having these ready is the first step towards a manual serverless deployment or a scalable server cluster.

Also, having these images means that developers will have an easier time setting up development environment. Instead of having to follow a specific set of instructions to set up something like PostgreSQL bare-metal, they can just download Docker and spin up an instance of the image, and have everything ready.

---

## What's next

<h3>Module suggestion</h3>

Building a graph requires a degree and a user. It is aware of degree requirements, and what modules you have already done. Being aware of all this information, modtree can suggest to you which modules you should take next, in order to keep your future the most open.

Currently, this is our priority criteria:

1. Whether the module is part of your degree requirements or not
2. How many modules would you unlock, if you were to complete this module

By prioritizing with these two criteria, you are sure to make constant progress in your degree, and that you will clear important modules first, so that you don’t run out of modules to take.

In the future, we intend to implement a reminder feature, to remind students to clear certain pre-requisites of higher modules they intend to take, so that they don’t have to worry about not being able to complete certain modules before graduation.

<h3>Community templates</h3>

Students might want to refer to seniors’ study plans, to see what kind of specializations to go for, or to find out if certain module combinations make sense.

In modtree, students will be able to search across existing the degrees made by the community, and fork a copy of their own.

<h3>Community module links</h3>

Currently, the linking of modules in the graph is purely based on NUSMod’s database.

However, lots of mods that are clearly linked are not recorded as so on NUSMods. For instance, CS1101S is not listed as one of CS2030S’s pre-requisites, even though it really is.

We plan to let users contribute community pre-requisites to act as a bridge between official pre-requisites and what’s really happening on the ground.

---

## Testing

<h3>Unit testing</h3>

To aid with quicker development, we write fast-running unit tests that each test only the smallest possible piece of code. These tests assume that every other parts work, so we use mocks to lighten the test run.

These tests run much faster than those that require a real database, since creating, populating, and finally dropping a database is very time-consuming compared to running pure JavaScript.

<h3>Integration testing</h3>

For integration testing, we spin up a database with the minimum records needed for the test, then run the function and then assert a few key points.

These tests are written with Jest and are per-project, meaning that if a project has been tested before, and no code has changed, it will not be tested again.

While developing, tests help us know if we’re on the right track, and with every pull request we have GitHub Actions run the tests to give us extra reassurance that the code functions as expected.

<h3>End-to-end testing</h3>

With our core business logic being implemented in Milestone 3, we needed to begin testing that our core business logic works for every release and merged pull request. While manual testing may work, it gets tedious and as humans, we may miss out some tests, or perform some tests wrongly.

Hence, we decided to implement automated end-to-end testing, so that we can compile a set of instructions and asserts to ensure that our core business logic works.

Since most of our business logic deals with stateful data, so we require a logged-in user to perform these tests. As such, we currently use a shared gmail account for testing.

<h3>User testing</h3>

We released our deployment to some friends and sourced for their feedback.

We received feedback that the post-login state looks quite similar to the pre-login state, since the only difference is that the sign in button is replaced by a user profile button. After some deliberation, we agreed that this is fine, because between the pre-login and the post-login, the user is redirected to their chose provider’s (Google/Facebook/Github) sign in page, which should make it obvious that they have signed in.

Some users suggested that adding a module should add its dependencies automatically. For example, adding CS2040 should add CS1010 in the graph automatically. We agree that this may be a useful feature, so we are considering implementing it in the future.

Overall, the common feedback was that users were satisfied with the features we provided, but they hoped that there were more features.

<h3>Evaluator’s testing</h3>

<h4>Login</h4>

Go to [modtree.vercel.app][web]. Click the sign in button. You can then choose between signing in with Google, Facebook, or Github.

You will be redirected to your chosen provider, and after you login, you will get redirected back to modtree.

After signing in, click on the user icon at the top-right. You should see your own email.

<h4>Core functionality</h4>

Search for any module, and click on a search result. You should see a modal pop up. This modal shows module information. You can add this module to your graph.

Added modules are color coded based on a few factors listed at the bottom right corner of the page.

Click on the user icon at the top-right, then click on “Your Profile”. This is where you can manage your graphs, degrees, and modules done/doing. You can experiment with this section in any way you want.
