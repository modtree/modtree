# Awesome Monorepo Tools

Below is a running list of additional monorepo tools that you may find useful in your turborepo.

üíØ = stuff we use or have used in [Turborepo's own monorepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo)

## Versioning, Publishing, and Changelog Generation

For the foreseeable future, `turbo` is not going to deal with package publishing. Versioning/Publishing is an extremely opinionated topic with a lot of existing solutions. Our advice is to avoid versioning packages altogether unless you actually need to publish them to npm for external consumption. If you have to version your packages, we really like the workflow of Changesets (especially for open source projects).

- [changesets/changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) - ü¶ã A way to manage your versioning and changelogs with a focus on monorepos
- [microsoft/beachball](https://github.com/microsoft/beachball) - The Sunniest Semantic Version Bumper
- [lerna/lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) - A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
- [lerna/lerna-changelog](https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog) - PR-based changelog generator with monorepo support
- [intuit/auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) - Generate releases based on semantic version labels on pull requests.

## Codebase Linting

- [typicode/husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - Modern native Git hooks made easy!
- [okonet/lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - Run linters on git staged files
- [danger/danger-js](https://github.com/danger/danger-js) - ‚ö†Ô∏è Stop saying "you forgot to ‚Ä¶" in code review

## e2e Testing

- [cypress-io/cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) - Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.
- [cypress-io/github-action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action) - Run Cypress in GitHub Actions
- [microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) - Build a cross-browser end-to-end test suite with Playwright.
- [microsoft/playwright-github-action](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-github-action) - Run Playwright tests on GitHub Actions

## Automation

- [Kodiak](https://kodiakhq.com/) - Automate your GitHub Pull Request merge behavior üíØ
- [preactjs/compressed-size-action](https://github.com/preactjs/compressed-size-action) - GitHub Action that adds compressed size changes to your PRs.
- [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) - Automated dependency updates built into GitHub üíØ

## Codemods and Code Generation

We are planning to officially add code generation to `turbo` sometime in the future. In the meantime, we suggest using [plopjs/plop](https://github.com/plopjs/plop).

- [sapegin/mrm](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm) - Codemods for your project config files
- [plopjs/plop](https://github.com/plopjs/plop) - Codegen CLI

- [airbnb/ts-migrate](https://github.com/airbnb/ts-migrate) - A tool to help migrate JavaScript code quickly and conveniently to TypeScript
- [dotansimha/graphql-code-generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) - A tool for generating code based on a GraphQL schema and GraphQL operations (query/mutation/subscription), with flexible support for custom plugins. üíØ
- [swagger-api/swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) - swagger-codegen contains a template-driven engine to generate documentation, API clients and server stubs in different languages by parsing your OpenAPI / Swagger definition.

## Infrastructure as Code

One of the cool things we discovered when building Turborepo is how beautifully it works with infrastructure-as-code solutions.

- [pulumi/pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) - Modern Infrastructure as Code. Any cloud, any language
- [aws/aws-cdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) - The AWS Cloud Development Kit is a framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code
