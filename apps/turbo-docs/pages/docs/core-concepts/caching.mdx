# Caching

Unlike other tools you may have used, `turbo` can cache emitted files and logs of previously run commands. It does this so it can skip work that's already been done, yielding incredible time savings.

By default, [`turbo run`](../reference/command-line-reference#turbo-run-task1-task2-1) considers any files emitted in the `dist/**` or `build/**` folders of a package task (defined in that package's `package.json` `scripts` object) to be cacheable. In addition, `turbo run` treats logs (`stderr` and`stdout`), which are automatically written to `.turbo/run-<command>.log`, as a cacheable artifact. By treating logs as artifacts, you can cache just about any command in your Turborepo.

## Configuring Cache Outputs

Using [`pipeline`](../reference/configuration#pipeline), you can configure cache conventions across your Turborepo.

To override the default cache output behavior, pass an array of globs to a [`pipeline.<task>.outputs`](../reference/configuration#outputs) array. Any file that satisfies the glob patterns for a task will be treated as artifact.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": [], // leave empty to only cache logs
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your task does not emit any files (e.g. unit tests with Jest), set `outputs` to an empty array (i.e. `[]`). Turborepo will automagically cache the logs for you.

  Pro Tip for caching ESLint: You can get a cacheable pretty terminal output
  (even for non-errors) by setting `TIMING=1` variable before `eslint`. Learn
  more over at the [ESLint
  docs](https://eslint.org/docs/1.0.0/developer-guide/working-with-rules#per-rule-performance)
</Callout>

With the above pipeline configuration and proper output folders, if you were to run:

```shell
# Run `build` npm script in all packages and apps and cache the output.
turbo run build test
```

And open up your `node_modules/.cache/turbo`, you should see the cached artifacts.

## Turn off caching

Sometimes you really don't need or want this cache behavior (such as when you're doing something with live reloading such as `next dev` or `react-scripts start`). To entirely disable caching, append `--no-cache` to any command:

```shell
# Run `dev` npm script in all packages and apps in parallel,
# but don't cache the output
turbo run dev --parallel --no-cache
```

You can also always disable caching on a specific task by setting `cache` to `false` in your Turborepo [`pipeline`](../reference/configuration#pipeline-1):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Alter Caching Based on Environment Variables and Files

For some tasks, you may not want a cache miss if an irrelevant file has changed. For instance, updating `README.md`
might not need to trigger a cache miss for the `test` task. You can use `inputs` to restrict the set
of files `turbo` considers for a particular task. In this case, only consider `.ts` and `.tsx` files relevant for
determining a cache hit on the `test` task:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // ...other tasks
    "test": {
      "outputs": [], // leave empty to only cache logs
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

When you use `turbo` with tools which inline environment variables at build time (e.g. Next.js or Create React App), it is important you tell `turbo` about it. Otherwise, you could ship a cached artifact with the wrong environment variables!

Luckily, you can control `turbo`'s cache fingerprinting (a.k.a. hashing) behavior based on the values of both environment variables and the contents of files:

- Including environment variables in a `dependsOn` in your `pipeline` definition prefixed by a `$` will impact the cache fingerprint on a per-task or per-package-task basis.
- Including environment variables in `globalDependencies` list prefixed by a `$` will impact the cache fingerprint of _all_ tasks.
- Including files or globs of files in `globalDependencies` will impact the cache fingerprint of _all_ tasks.
- The value of any environment variable that includes `THASH` in its name will impact the cache fingerprint of _all_ tasks.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": [
        "^build",
        // env vars will impact hashes of all "build" tasks
        "$SOME_ENV_VAR",
      ],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "web#build": { // override settings for the "build" task for the "web" app
      "dependsOn": [
        "^build",
        // env vars that will impact the hash of "build" task for only "web" app
        "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY",
        "$NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "$NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID",
      ],
      "outputs": [".next/**"],
    },
    "docs#build": { // override settings for the "build" task for the "docs" app
      "dependsOn": [
        "^build",
        // env vars that will impact the hash of "build" task for only "docs" app
        "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY",
        "$NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "$NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID",
      ],
      "outputs": [".next/**"],
    }
  },
  "baseBranch": "origin/main",
  "globalDependencies": [
    "$GITHUB_TOKEN",// env var that will impact the hashes of all tasks,
    "tsconfig.json", // file contents will impact the hashes of all tasks,
    ".env.*", // glob file contents will impact the hashes of all tasks,
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Pro Tip: In most monorepos, you don't often use environment variables in shared packages, but mostly only in applications. Thus, to get higher cache hit rates, you should likely only include environment variables in the app-specific tasks where they are used/inlined.
</Callout>

## Force overwrite cache

Conversely, if you want to force `turbo` to re-execute a previously cached task, add the `--force` flag:

```shell
# Run `build` npm script in all packages and apps,
# ignoring cache hits.
turbo run build --force
```

## Logs

Not only does `turbo` cache the output of your tasks, it also records the terminal output (i.e. combined `stdout` and `stderr`) to (`<package>/.turbo/run-<command>.log`). When `turbo` encounters a cached task, it will replay the output as if it happened again, but instantly, with the package name slightly dimmed.

## Hashing

By now, you're probably wondering how `turbo` decides what constitutes a cache hit vs. miss for a given task. Good question!

First `turbo` constructs a hash of the current global state of the monorepo:

- The contents of any files that satisfy the glob patterns and any the values of environment variables listed in [`globalDependencies`](../reference/configuration#globalDependencies-1)
- The sorted list environment variable key-value pairs that includes `THASH` _anywhere_ in their names (e.g. `STRIPE_PUBLIC_THASH_SECRET_KEY` but not `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`)

Then it adds on more factors relative to a given package's task:

- Hash the contents of all not-gitignored files in the package folder or the files matching the `inputs` globs, if present
- The hashes of all internal dependencies
- The `outputs` option specified in the [`pipeline`](../reference/configuration#pipeline)
- The set of resolved versions of all installed `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies` specified in a package's `package.json` from the root lockfile
- The package task's name
- The sorted list of environment variable key-value pairs that correspond to the environment variable names listed in applicable [`pipeline.<task-or-package-task>.dependsOn`](../reference/configuration#dependson) list.

Once `turbo` encounters a given package's task in its execution, it checks the cache (both locally and remotely) for a matching hash. If it's a match, it skips executing that task, moves or downloads the cached output into place and replays the previously recorded logs instantly. If there isn't anything in the cache (either locally or remotely) that matches the calculated hash, `turbo` will execute the task locally and then cache the specified `outputs` using the hash as an index.

The hash of a given task is injected at execution time as an environment variable `TURBO_HASH`. This value can be useful in stamping outputs or tagging Dockerfile etc.

<Callout>
  As of `turbo` v0.6.10, `turbo`'s hashing algorithm when using `npm` or `pnpm`
  differs slightly from the above. When using either of these package managers,
  `turbo` will include the hashed contents of the lockfile in its hash
  algorithm for each package's task. It will _not_ parse/figure out the resolved
  set of all dependencies like the current `yarn` implementation.
