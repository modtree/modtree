f4e6cbd1-c8f4-4dd4-9db3-c2efaa072423	MUA3228	Re-imagining Pianism through Analysis	This is an elective open to Conservatory piano students and all NUS students. Students are required to be fluent in harmony (functional harmony and chromatic harmony) as the class offers an application of (rather than an introduction to) harmony. As such, NUS students would be advised to have taken either MUA 3224 or MUA 1201. For those seeking direct entry MEP study at Junior College would offer sufficient background as well. However is not a must to have experienced either of the above to be deemed as having sufficient background. Students must decide for themselves after 2 weeks of classes.			""	""

The prerequisite is that students should have completed at least one Junior or Senior Seminar at the College, as well as at least one Ideas and Exposition module or a faculty-based writing course.\n\nFor student-candidates who meet the prerequisite but who have not finished the five-module UTCP, the prospective supervisor/research leader is required to make a case to the UROP coordinator and/or the Director of Studies. The case should be based on (1) an evaluation of the student’s demonstrated aptitude and motivation for independent research and inquiry, and (2) the student’s demonstrated potential for producing high-quality academic writing.
